# Phronesis

**Practical wisdom from agent experience.**  

Phronesis bridges the gap between OpenCode's powerful plugin ecosystem and Hermes Agent's adaptive learning capabilities. It brings auto-skill creation, session memory, self-improving skills, and intelligent experience reuse to OpenCode — turning raw agent interactions into compounding practical wisdom.

## Why

OpenCode has a rich plugin architecture, full MCP support, and a solid skill system — but it lacks the learning loop that makes Hermes Agent feel alive:

- **No auto-skill creation** — complex workflows are forgotten after the session
- **No session search** — past conversations are opaque
- **No self-improving skills** — SKILL.md files are static
- **No multi-platform gateway** — agents are TUI/CLI/Desktop only

Phronesis fills these gaps, one plugin at a time.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Leverage existing infrastructure** — SKILL.md, SQLite sessions, 20+ plugin hooks, MCP. Never rebuild what's already there.
2. **Composability over monoliths** — Each capability is a standalone OpenCode plugin that works independently and together.
3. **Learning as the differentiator** — The single highest-leverage feature is auto-skill creation. It compounds every session.

*Phronesis is architected and directed by human engineering. Implementation is built collaboratively with OpenCode AI agents — every design decision, tradeoff, and architecture choice is human-owned; the agents execute under active direction.*
